# nextup-cli

## Features (in progress)

* Welcome message showing the task that is next up in your list
* Complete function (completes a task and removes it from your list and addes it to the completed list)
* Skip function (pushes back the current next up item in your list)
* Create function (creates a new task, default goes to end of list, optionally make it the next up task)
* Delete function to delete a task entirely


## Future ideas

* Multiple lists to jump between 
* Ability to reorder the list all at once
* All time task completion tasks
