# nextup-cli

## Features (in progress)

* On running nextup it should show:
  * The item in your list that is nextup or
  * A message saying you have no tasks and the "nextup help" command
* Complete function (Removes the nextup task from your list if a task is not specified and increments the completed count)
* Skip function (Moves the current next up item in your list to the end)
* Create function (creates a new task, default goes to end of list, optionally make it the next up task)
* Delete function (Removes the specified task and does not increment the completed count)


## Future ideas

* Multiple lists to jump between 
* Ability to reorder the list all at once
